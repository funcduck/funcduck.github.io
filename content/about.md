# About

Hi, I'm Oscar, and this is my little internet islet. I'm a software engineer building for the web. I enjoy reading, listening to, and [playing music](#music).

## Music

Drums have been my main instrument, and it's what I've played in the bands I've been part of. Bands I've played with include:

- [Spring Johnny!](https://springjohnny.se/) - Played drums, recorded 3 EPs, performed live extensively, and appeared on regional Swedish television.
- [Dandelion Tree Band](https://soundcloud.com/dandeliontreeband) - Played drums, contributed vocals, and collaborated on songwriting and arrangements.
